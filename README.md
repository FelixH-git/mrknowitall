I am messing around with web crawlers, and they search science articles summaries using GPT-4 and save them to a file. Uses the ´selenium´ web driver to avoid JavaScript activation, and reads the article. It practically reads only the abstract.

# TODO
Add, using ´requests´, as a parameter instead of web driver because it's annoying. The goal is to actually read the paper instead of just the abstract, but the token length of GPT-4 is too small.
