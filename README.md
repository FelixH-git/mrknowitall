# mrknowitall
Messing around with webcrawlers, searches science articles summaries using gpt-4 and saves it to a file, Uses selenium webdriver to avoid javascript activation stuff and reads(not the pdf) the article, 
basically just the abstract

# TODO
add (use requests) as a parameter instead of webdriver cause its annoying, actually read the paper instead of just the abstract, but token length of gpt4 too small
# DO YOU EVEN READ STUDIES BRO
